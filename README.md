## Project Title
Catsie
## Description
This is a small page I made to apply my learnings of HTML and CSS. This page shows three cards on which there are some details about my three most favourite cat breeds! I also made a non fucntional nav bar which has a gradient background. 
This is just for a small learning experience. 
## Tech Used
- HTML5: For structure of page.
- CSS3: For styling and layout.
